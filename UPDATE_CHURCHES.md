# Update Churches List

## Current Seed File

The seed file currently has 13 placeholder churches. We need to replace them with your actual churches from the PDF.

## How to Update

### Option 1: Share the Church List

Please share the church information from the PDF. I need:
- Church name
- Location (city, state)
- Pastor name
- Pastor phone (optional)
- Pastor email (optional)

### Option 2: I'll Update the Seed File

Once you provide the church list, I'll update `supabase/seed.sql` with your actual churches.

## Format Needed

For each church, I need:
```
Church Name: [Name]
Location: [City, State]
Pastor Name: [Name]
Pastor Phone: [optional]
Pastor Email: [optional]
```

## Example

```
Church Name: Word Ministries - Delhi
Location: Delhi, Delhi
Pastor Name: Pastor John Doe
Pastor Phone: +91-9876543210
Pastor Email: pastor.delhi@wmoi.org
```
